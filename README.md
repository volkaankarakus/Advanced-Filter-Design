Filter Design Using Bilinear Transform
Filters are designed for the desired values of Passband and Stopband Ripples and Frequencies.
Passband attenuation, stopband attenuation, sampling frequency were calculated respectively, and then this value vas converted to a Decibel Value.
Bilinear Transform was applied to this value and the Cut-off Frequency was found from here.
Then Butterworth Filter Coefficients were calculated and normalized.
Magnitude Response, Impulse Response, and Zero-Pole graphics are drawn for the accuracy of the operations.
